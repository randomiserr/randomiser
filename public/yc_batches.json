First month: finished netflix :) Then he spent two months reviewing 20 years of voice tech research papers in chronological order… and somewhere in there realized that there is an opportunity to make amazing voice models for smaller languages — faster than big tech.\n\nAt the core, we are solving the problem of universal access to digital knowledge and digital services. People who would previously never use certain digital services (like online ordering, or online health advice), actually use the service when they are given an intuitive Voice based interface — especially in emerging markets. Voice Interfaces make it more natural and intuitive to use technology; and we believe it will onboard 100s of millions of new users onto digital services. This will make people more productive, and increase GDP per capita.\n\nWhen we truly succeed, the world will access technology through our Voice Tech. And the GDP per capita would increase around the world, as more people will be able to take full advantage of technology using intuitive voice interfaces. Currently a large part of the world is unable to fully utilize technology coz text-interfaces are very confusing for many people.",

As brothers-in-law, we’re passionate about rebuilding the U.S. industrial base — not through taxes and subsidies, but through real technological innovation. Our mission is to help America reclaim its place as the world’s greatest builder of tangible things.\n\nMagnesium, titanium, aluminum, hafnium, and zirconium are all listed on the DOE’s Critical Minerals List, with magnesium ranked among the highest in both supply risk and strategic importance to U.S. energy security. The U.S. has zero domestic magnesium production and no titanium sponge production — yet both are indispensable for fighter jets, missiles, satellites, rockets, and advanced aerospace systems.\n\nChina and Russia control ~97% of magnesium and ~90% of titanium production (directly or indirectly).",

We solve this by combining advanced optimization with LLMs that can adapt algorithms to deliver intelligent planning for real-world operations. https://youtu.be/9LHYILVw6ks\n\nPlanning just one week of routes for a 50-truck fleet involves more possible combinations than there are grains of sand on Earth . For humans, consistently piecing together reasonable combinations is difficult. Making optimal ones is impossible. Dispatchers juggle:\n\nThis complexity forces fleets to effectively silo their operations —assigning each dispatcher a subset of trucks to manage. Instead of coordinating as a cohesive operation, fleets become mini-operations, resulting in load mismatches and under-utilized capacity. For a low-margin industry like trucking, those inefficiencies are the difference between making or missing payroll.\n\nIn response, some fleets have adopted expensive load planning algorithms.

Locata eliminates that burden by automating the entire process with AI. This helps health centers streamline their operations, reduce costs, and ensure patients get timely care.\n\nReferrals are one of the most critical, yet most broken, parts of the US healthcare system. Health centers are required to track specialist referrals to ensure continuity of patient care and meet quality standards. But with limited staff and overwhelming administrative demands, health centers struggle to keep up, leading many to outsource the work.\n\nThese operational inefficiencies create major financial risks for health centers. On top of the resources centers already deploy to manage referrals, failure to effectively close the loop puts quality standards in jeopardy, carrying even greater financial implications.",

   "YC_Description": "We’re Nathan & Antonio, building an AI HR manager for hourly teams. Running an hourly workforce means drowning in admin: verifying timesheets, tracking attendance, chasing down approvals. Businesses can spend up to 6 hours a week just verifying timesheets for a team of 15 employees. Nathan led the QuickBooks Payroll & Time Tracking app from unranked to #12 on the App Store and saw firsthand how fast this overhead grows. We automate the repetitive HR work — so owners and managers can focus on growing their business, not paperwork.\n\nManaging hourly teams is still painfully manual. Over 70% of businesses rely on paper, spreadsheets, and text chains to handle critical tasks like scheduling, time tracking, and finding shift coverage. The tools that do exist are clunky, built for desk workers, and assume a level of tech-savviness many frontline teams don’t have. Meanwhile, managers spend hours each week buried in admin — verifying timesheets, coordinating shifts, and chasing down approvals — instead of focusing on their people.\n\nWe meet hourly teams where they are — with voice agents and the simplest possible app. Our platform automates back-office HR by handling tasks like calling workers for shifts, clocking them in automatically, ensuring breaks, flagging missed punches, and completing payroll review. No more chasing, checking, or double entry — just smooth, automated execution of the work that usually slows teams down.\n\nDo you know any business owners who pay employees hourly?

Drawings carry the bulk of design intent—fit, form, function, and fabrication—and act as the important source of truth across production, quality, and supply chain.\n\nGD&T standards from ASME and ISO exist to formalize this communication. But they’re dense and confusing. Across major revision years, there are thousands of pages of definitions, edge cases, and revision quirks.

Long waits and frustrating conversations with agents who are underpaid, poorly trained, and burned out by repetitive work are the norm.

The model relies on large pools of low-wage, undertrained workers, and gaps in language or cultural context make interactions slower and less effective.

Her inbox had 30-50 emails - some urgent, some cold outreach, and many irrelevant promotional messages. The truly important stuff was buried. At the same time, she was bouncing from one meeting to another - customers, investors, advisors – with barely any time to prep. Akash had his own share of chaos - engineering updates, newsletters, and a sea of miscellaneous stuff piling up during his long drive to work. He also had to prep for meetings with the team, offshore engineers and stakeholders! We both needed an Executive Assistant. The kind who reads your inbox, flags the urgent stuff, sends replies for you, gets you prepped before meetings, and gives you that extra ten minutes to snooze in the morning because you're catching up on things en route. But we couldn’t afford one. So we built our own! ✅ The Solution: April is your voice-powered AI Executive Assistant. She handles your inbox and calendar, so you can stop reacting to email & calendar overload and start owning your day. Speak to her. Ask her to find the urgent emails, draft and send your replies with perfect grammar, notify your team of updates while you're driving or on the move, and yes – she can also delete all the spam, promotions, and noisy junk that doesn’t belong in your inbox, all hands-free.\n\nApril helps you prep like a pro for meetings. Ask her for context before a customer call or engineering sync, RSVP hands-free, reschedule on the go, or create new events - just with voice . April learns your patterns, preferences and style of communication to serve you better every time. Cut out the busywork and create time for more meaningful work. The Team:",

We’ve seen firsthand the challenges with manual claims handling and how AI can fundamentally transform this process\n\nYearly insurance claim payouts total more than $6.5 trillion (6% of worldwide GDP). The way insurance is sold has evolved considerably, but the handling of claims has remained largely unchanged since the early days of the internet. Due to the inconsistent nature of manual processing, handling errors alone are estimated to cause more than $200B in wrongful payouts per year. Add another $75B to that number for administrative operating expenses, and a rough idea of the true cost emerges.\n\nThe industry’s fix to this problem?

Information locked in outdated ERPs, legacy practice management systems, email inboxes, and non-standardized supplier websites creates countless hours of manual data collection and entry, resulting in inefficiencies, errors, and severely limited visibility into real-time profitability. Traditional automation has historically failed due to these complexities, and even impressive general-purpose AI tools like ChatGPT aren't designed to tackle such nuanced operational realities.\n\nDoe solves this by embedding task-specific AI agents that leverage the unique capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to deeply understand and interact directly with these challenging, fragmented systems...even those without formal APIs. Our platform seamlessly connects to ERPs, legacy practice management systems, email inboxes, and supplier websites, autonomously managing procurement, inventory optimization, approvals, scheduling, compliance, and analytics. For example, procurement teams instantly know exactly which practices risk running low on critical supplies, automatically reorder inventory from approved suppliers at optimal pricing, and proactively address compliance issues without manual oversight. CFOs gain immediate visibility into real-time profitability across locations, pinpointing precisely where and why financial improvements can be made.",

We empower farmers with early disease detection and reproductive insights that save them time and money.\n\nEfficiently monitoring cattle health and reproduction is critical to maintain farm profitability. But the traditional practice of manually inspecting animals doesn’t scale - labor costs add up, while farms miss disease outbreaks and breeding cycles. Disease alone causes ~$100 billion in losses yearly for cattle farms globally.\n\nExisting tech for monitoring cattle includes external wearables like collars and ear-tags. Being outside thick cattle skin, these can’t accurately track useful biometrics beyond “activity” (a glorified step-count). There’s also boluses, pill-shaped devices that sit in the cow stomach. But these are super expensive, have short battery life, and can’t be used for beef cattle.\n\nNexa is building implantable microchips that go underneath the skin in the ear of cattle. We analyze vital biometrics - like temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen, activity, GPS location, and more - that other systems miss, to empower farmers with early disease detection and reproductive insights. And because our electronics operate at millimeter scale, we benefit from low production costs and pricing up to 70% cheaper than current solutions.",

Opaque: Scattered logs and siloed security make it impossible to trace “which agent did what, with which parameters” when something goes wrong, leaving teams blind in audits or incident response. Slow: Security reviews drag on for weeks because least-privilege and policy checks are hard to implement at scale, delaying projects and eroding velocity. Overexposed: Agents often get blanket root access, with no guardrails to stop prompt-injection or malicious payload swaps, so one bad input can become a catastrophic action. The result: enterprises face agents that can and do take unsafe actions in production, forcing teams to choose between unacceptable risk or shelving AI initiatives entirely. Our Solution",

We’re building a secure, AI-native IDE for data science—and as a first step, we’ve built an AI coding assistant into RStudio (think Cursor for RStudio). We’re looking for RStudio users, data scientists, and students who want to code way faster and are excited to see AI integrated into data science workflows.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c47Ch1kB0eU\n\nRStudio is used by about 5 million data scientists and academics, but they currently lack a coding assistant within their IDE. Developers in other environments benefit from tools like Cursor and Windsurf, but R users don’t have an equivalent tool that’s truly integrated into their day-to-day workflow. And more broadly, data science teams need an AI-native environment that understands notebooks, dataframes, plots, and multi-language workflows—without forcing work into the cloud or tools they don’t use.\n\nWe’re building a secure, AI-native IDE for data science that is context-aware (files, variables, terminals), can read and write code, run analyses, and interpret textual or visual output across R and Python to start. While we build this IDE, we’ve shipped Rao: a fork of RStudio with an embedded AI assistant that is aware of the user’s local context (both files and variable environment), can read and write files, can run code or commands, and can interpret textual or visual output. It works with the file formats RStudio users already rely on (R, notebooks including RMDs and QMDs, Python, Stan, etc.), so you can iteratively perform entire data analyses inside your preferred IDE today—and help us design the next one.",

This enables rapid deployment and a unique business model where we can let companies pay by-the-hour, instead of requiring massive capex. We already have a biotech unicorn using our robots in production to package delicate chemical vials.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHzjweFnbkk&feature=youtu.be\n\nTraditional robot arms often require months of custom engineering and planning to integrate. These bulky, rigid, and expensive systems take up substantial floor space and are hard-coded for a single workflow. Adapting to new tasks means weeks of downtime and reprogramming. As a result, companies often default to increasing headcount to keep up with demand.\n\nOur first product – Nemo3 – is a bimanual robot that can handle objects within a 2.5-foot radius, supports payloads up to 4 lbs, and can be mounted flexibly in various environments. Unlike traditional robot arms, Nemo3 rapidly learns new tasks and adapts to changing conditions on the fly. Our AI decomposes 30 minutes of tele-operation data into skills and uses diffusion models to learn each skill. The result is fast and robust automation for our customers.",

Customers expect enthusiasm and compassion, yet every business relies on a team of overworked CSRs. Calls slip to voicemail, jobs fall through the cracks, and constant churn in the office means no one really owns the customer experience. Outdated phone trees frustrate callers, slow down bookings, and make growth expensive. Contractors lose thousands each month in missed revenue while their customers get service that feels decades behind.\n\nThe Solution Acrely provides an AI Customer Service Representative. It greets customers naturally, books jobs, dispatches techs, handles follow-up, and never misses a call. It’s not just voice AI - it integrates directly with ServiceTitan and other CRMs so jobs are booked, not just recorded. By replacing missed calls and inconsistent service with always-on, reliable customer care, contractors book more jobs, keep customers happier, and scale without adding headcount. We were originally building voice AI scheduling for real estate agents but home services businesses came inbound to us asking to use it.",

A few weeks later, we sat down with her to see what AI could take off her plate. Turns out, a lot!\n\nWe estimate commercial brokers work 60 hours a week, and 35 of those hours could be automated away with AI. This is especially true for the deal process: generating client deliverables, verifying listing details, and valuing properties. These three tasks represent about 60% of time and money spent by CRE brokers today. What We’re Building Closera is the AI platform for commercial real estate brokerages. We automate their most repetitive workflows across sales, marketing, and property valuation, saving them hours each day.

   "YC_Description": "Cascade Space is building a turn-key communications system for lunar and deep space missions. Our ground station network and integrated software tools work together to maximize uptime and availability, while reducing spacecraft iteration cycles from weeks to hours.\n\nThe Deep Space Network (DSN), NASA’s global network of ground terminals for communicating with deep space probes, is oversubscribed by 40% and in desperate need of upgrades. The DSN is all but unavailable for most commercial operations. Companies with missions going to the Moon and beyond have to deal with a patchwork of individual dish operators for every mission, each with bespoke hardware, specs, and interfaces. Furthermore, many of these commercial providers are not able to handle the demand and operational failures also can lead to loss of mission .\n\nComms system design is fraught with peril\n\nThe spacecraft comms system design is tightly coupled to the available ground network. Engineers spend hundreds of hours poring over datasheets, on the phone with vendors and suppliers, and endless email threads, only to put all this data into a giant spreadsheet to make sense of it. Every iteration requires not only painful attention to detail, but also in-depth esoteric knowledge of how radio frequency systems and channel coding schemes work in order to accurately predict in-flight performance. Simple misunderstandings can lead to catastrophic errors in design and configuration.",

You can email us at founders@usesieve.com .\n\nAfter studying CS at MIT, I worked at Citadel and McKinsey, and Savannah worked at Bain. We've dealt with this problem first hand and were amazed that there weren't good solutions.\n\nsieve lets hedge funds replace manual review in their data pipelines with a simple API call, so their engineers and analysts can get back to more differentiated work. Behind the scenes, we use AI to find and retrieve the appropriate source documents and to extract the requested data. Each data point is reviewed by a team of expert reviewers before being returned to the client. This lets us achieve the level of accuracy hedge funds need, and that AI-only approaches aren't able to achieve.",

   "YC_Description": "TL;DR: AI-powered truck management software to automate back-office operations for trucking companies. Check us Out!\n\nTrucking has always been a mission critical industry, with nearly 70% of all US goods hauled via trucks, resulting in a need for continuous operations. This results in an industry that hasn’t paused for a tech update in years; in my time in the industry, I saw dozens of offices running on pen and paper or excel spreadsheets, documents being sent in WhatsApp group chats connected to printers, and I myself had 3 phones all on hold menus with different people. And even the largest of companies today navigate a maze of outdated, poorly integrated point-solutions.\n\nSo, alongside Anthony and Sam, I decided to build a product that rectifies those problems. With Hemut’s software, you can replace pen and paper scribbles with intuitive oversight of even national level fleets, replace the WhatsApp group chats and manual data entry with AI document parsing, and eliminate the need for 3 phones with AI agents to automate inbound/outbound calls. With Hemut, trucking companies can execute every step of the trucking workflow—from finding and booking a shipment, driver communication, and logging every last dollar—all on one platform, with efficiency never seen before.\n\nAt 16 years old, I got kicked out of my home and faced homelessness, working 100-hour weeks at a motel where I met a truck driver who I eventually helped file paperwork for. Siezing the opportunity, I also helped file paperwork for his friends too, eventually saving enough money to start dispatching trucks and put a roof over my head.",

With Navrim, we've changed the game. Our $200 robot arm, powered by cutting-edge foundation models, enables anyone to effortlessly teach robots new skills—like playing chess—in less than 30 minutes, without writing a single line of code.\n\nIn just the past week, we've fine-tuned 12 foundation models for our early users, and we're preparing to ship our first batch of 20 units by the end of this month.",

We help you measure performance and define rewards for reinforcement learning.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56LpwoPxqjc\n\nEvaluating model performance is an opaque art and vanilla LLM judges do not provide the necessary signal to measure output quality. Additionally, modern GRPO-style RL techniques offer rapid, generalizable improvements to model performance, but they require well-specified eval datasets to be used as rewards. We help you quickly specify high signal evals across a variety of unstructured tasks with aligned graders, fine-grained rubrics and fast iteration. Our eval workspace – doteval – offers a Cursor-like experience to edit evals-as-code against our .yaml schema. Version evals across checkpoints, replace manual effort with AI-generated diffs, and compare eval runs on tight-execution loops to align them with your IP. This way, you can confidently determine whether you should upgrade to Claude 4 or stay on Gemini 2.5 Pro, or whether this new 12,000 word prompt actually creates net improvement over that 8,000 word prompt. You can also one-click export the spec to be used as the training set for RL and post-train your own model.\n\nToday, we work with frontier AI teams to benchmark performance for complex model tasks.

In the last eight months , we’ve grown from $1K to $70K MRR , with 150,000 monthly active users , by providing concise notes, an AI tutor you can talk to, and personalized tests based on your learning materials.\n\nWe met two weeks into college and started hacking on projects in our dorm. By sophomore year, we were fed up with watching long, outdated lecture videos and reading dense textbooks , only to forget a few days later. Generic AI tools gave quick answers , but those shortcuts left us with only surface-level understanding . We kept cramming before exams , forgetting most of it soon after, and repeating the same cycle.\n\nOut of that frustration, we built YouLearn . Upload any learning material, and YouLearn turns it into clear notes , an AI tutor that walks you through the topic, and adaptive quizzes to help you remember. Learning is now faster, easier, and more memorable.",

Then you can observe and manage it through our gateway.\n\nOver the past few weeks, we spoke with over 40 teams building MCP servers. Everyone hit the same walls: wiring up authentication, figuring out how to trace agent calls, setting up working transports, and debugging behavior in production. The MCP spec doesn’t cover these parts.

This mapping is enhanced with customer conversation transcripts, Slack threads, and support tickets to create tailored content for each user. SAMMY updates automatically with every product change, ensuring smooth operations. It might feel like magic, but it’s simply powerful technology at work.\n\nIn his time leading teams at Palantir, our CEO, Joe, managed user onboarding processes for multiple enterprise customers - each with 1000s of end users. After over 150 onboarding calls, one thing became clear: a generic approach to user enablement simply doesn’t work. Users decide within minutes if your software meets their unique needs - if they’re met with a cookie-cutter process, their interest evaporates. We’ve all been there: 'I just want to do [X]!' only to be forced down a path that starts with [Y].  However, the manual process of updating and creating training & onboarding materials couldn’t keep up with rapid product changes or deliver the specificity users demanded. Shav, our CTO, was building real-time AI & data-streaming stacks in the fintech space. He saw first-hand how critical it is to give users relevant, up-to-date information. These insights, alongside his modelling expertise, shaped SAMMY’s AI architecture to continuously map and update all onboarding, support, and training materials in real-time.

A growing global space race to exploit the Moon's resources, with over 450 planned lunar missions over the next 8 years, means this lack of a GPS analogue on the Moon could cost Moon-bound companies billions over the next decade.\n\nWe’re miniaturizing GNSS satellite architecture to fit into a CubeSat format, massively decreasing manufacturing and launch costs from the current $250m per satellite to less than $5m. We plan to launch our first 4 satellites into lunar orbit by the end of next year, providing partial coverage over the lunar south pole and expanding to full coverage over the next few years.\n\nWe’re currently building the Baseline Orbital Ranging Device (BORD), our technology demonstrator CubeSat, which we’re launching into Low Earth Orbit later this year for in-orbit testing of our navigation payload.",

   "YC_Description": "TL;DR Spott is building AI agents for recruiting firms to replace legacy recruiting platforms like Bullhorn. Today, headhunters use our first agent to generate detailed candidate presentation reports in their template within minutes, using data they already own.\n\nHeadhunters create detailed reports for every candidate they propose to a company at the end of their search process. Manually writing these reports from scratch can take several hours, while most of the required inputs are readily available in their recruitment platform (think CV, cover letter, job description, interview notes). Similar tasks such as rewriting job descriptions and CVs are time and labor-intensive, adding up to ~10% of the total workload. These tasks primarily involve converting raw information into standardized formats, which is time-consuming and slows down the hiring process.\n\n📈Solution Spott's candidate report writing agent streamlines this process by ingesting CVs, job descriptions, and interview notes to generate polished drafts in seconds. You can import recordings of in-person conversations and link transcripts from Zoom or Teams meetings to quickly create an 80% complete draft. Our context-rich editor, powered by AI, helps you efficiently finalize your report in minimal time. What sets Spott apart from ChatGPT and comparable solutions is the exceptional quality of its reports, the anonymized processing of sensitive client data, and the ability to export directly to your custom Word or PowerPoint templates. Our solution allows exec search recruiters to truly create reports in minutes rather than hours.\n\nFounders Founders Manu , Samuel , and Lander bring recruiting expertise from McKinsey, BCG, and Bain. There, we saw clients struggle with legacy systems and realized AI-powered solutions could prove a transformative growth lever in executive search. Our goal: build the recruitment platform for the next generation of executive search firms.",

We’ve successfully built our first functional prototype in just 4 months—an incredible milestone that sets us on the path to shipping to researchers soon. Our unique approach to data collection —where we collect data through human interaction rather than teleoperating robots—has significantly increased the efficiency of our data gathering. This enables us to train more effective AI models for manipulation and task execution.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEo4WlCanMc\n\nOur robotic hands are just the beginning. In the next few years, we’ll expand from hands to fully autonomous humanoid robots capable of performing a wide range of tasks across industries.

We are starting with the challenges around portfolio management as the majority of these firms still rely on manual data entry (primarily through spreadsheets) for tracking investments, which is not only time-consuming but also introduces a 40% higher likelihood of errors compared to automated systems.\n\nHigh-cost portfolio management platforms, often priced at least $100k annually , fail to fully automate data integration, requiring substantial manual input. This inefficiency reduces focus on strategic activities like identifying new investment opportunities or optimizing asset allocation.\n\nWe believe investment firms deserve a better solution: an affordable, automated platform that seamlessly integrates data, eliminates manual workflows, and empowers investors to focus on what matters—growing and preserving capital.

   "YC_Description": "Hey everyone, we are Will and Stef from Reditus Space! The Problem\n\nAccess and Return from space is almost entirely dependent on the International Space Station (ISS), a costly, slow, and overly bureaucratic process. Zero-G manufacturing is currently at a turning point, transitioning from research to producing materials for use on Earth. The current space infrastructure cannot provide consistent access & return for zero-g manufacturing, and that is where we come in.\n\nThe absence of gravity in space means that there is no sedimentation or convection. In turn, that means during the formation of materials, you are able to make them more homogenous on an atomic level. This has huge implications for pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and biologics. You are able to create materials in space that cannot be produced on Earth. In short, the material production has to be so precise that gravity is too much of a disturbing force and needs to be removed.\n\nWhat are we building right now? Right now we are working on our first full-scale re-entry mission, the ENOS mission, which will be launching on a Falcon 9 in a launch window starting in March '26. We will be hosting a pharmaceutical R&D payload on-orbit and fully re-enter and recover the satellite. Check out the following video for more info about ENOS! https://youtu.be/XRhSN3fWv78",

Through this, Peppr ensures that no matter how much your team scales in size, it can still operate with the same speed as the leanest startups.\n\nAs companies scale, their teams inevitably grow—and so does their information. Projects multiply, contacts proliferate, and goals stack up. Critical details sink into buried Slack threads, outdated Confluence docs, and a myriad of PM tools. This not only leads to incessant handoff meetings and endless email threads, but 90% of critical knowledge remains undocumented (in large U.S. businesses) due to inefficient knowledge-sharing.\n\nPeppr AI is built to solve these deep-seated knowledge bottlenecks.\n\nUnlike tools that rely on employees manually documenting what they do (which we all know they don’t ;) , Peppr autonomously captures critical insights hidden in engineering workflows—surfacing the knowledge that typically goes undocumented.",

Our customers use us to move money cross-border on same-day with low fees, all without crypto complexity.\n\nAfter talking to over hundreds of merchants and payment processors, we found that global payments are slow, expensive, and unreliable. Traditional financial rails such as SWIFT result in high fees and multi-day delays with little transparency on the state of their transfer. Yet companies, both big and small, struggle to adopt stablecoins due to complex compliance requirements and fragmented vendor integrations.\n\nWe're building what merchants worldwide need: fast, affordable global payment rails that can be integrated in days instead of months. Infinite can process same-day payments to over 170 countries, enabling businesses to leverage stablecoins as a settlement network (a la SWIFT) for cross-border payments. Our network of on and off-ramps provides connectivity to local fiat funding and payout flows, enabling faster global money movement and our turnkey SDKs and APIs allow businesses to embed stablecoins into their applications faster.

For example, when a rep is handling a credit card dispute, Calltree can identify that reps spend 30 seconds per call on manual data gathering and data entry, propose a solution, and measure the opex savings. Calltree surfaces these insights in an analytics tool and generates reports, making it easy for operation leaders to build business cases to prioritize improvements, realizing millions in opex savings.\n\nAsk: If cutting every second matters to your call center, please email us kun@calltree.ai and rob@calltree.ai or book a demo here.\n\nLarge enterprises track every second of a phone call because reducing average call time can save millions of dollars each year. However, enterprises don't have a scalable way to find these inefficiencies. Manual time studies (in person shadowing call center reps, etc.) are tedious, unscalable, and expensive.\n\nMany contact centers don’t just record the audio of customer calls; they also capture everything the rep does on their screen for training, compliance, and quality assurance.

Confident AI allows engineering teams to iterate on their LLM app x10 faster by bringing DeepEval to the cloud.\n\nDespite LLM evaluation being a problem with many solutions on the market, it remains unsolved. General LLMOps observability platforms that offer evals lack robust metrics and are more suited for debugging through tracing UIs, while evaluation-focused frameworks don’t offer enough control for users to customize and make metrics reliable for specific use cases.\n\nAs a result, developers often build custom evaluation metrics and pipelines from scratch—writing hundreds or even thousands of lines of code to test their LLM apps. The worst part? Once they’ve fine-tuned their metrics and are ready to deploy them across the organization, they hit a roadblock: there’s no easy way to collaborate. Because these custom metrics exist in scattered code rather than an integrated ecosystem, incorporating them to enable team-wide adoption becomes frustrating and inefficient.\n\nWe built DeepEval for engineers to create use-case-specific, deterministic LLM evaluation metrics, and when you're ready, Confident AI brings these evaluation results to the cloud.

We increase developer velocity and, most of all, ensure companies are not forced onto Kafka when they don't actually need event streaming.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ulxmwrp_N5Q\n\nGrowing companies are forced to adopt micro-services as their desire to give engineering teams autonomy increases. The number one reported problem in this architecture paradigm is data silos . Silos create high coordination overhead when integrating data from other engineering teams, slowing down development and delaying product launches.\n\nThe industry has defaulted to event streaming platforms like Kafka to enable teams to share data asynchronously. As a result, enterprise software architectures are pushed into an event-driven model. However, events come with inherent complexity—they encode something happening rather than something being (i.e., state).",

One day, your agent is working fine; the next, it’s breaking for no reason. With misaligned reasoning, brittle logic chains, unclear failure cases, or silent performance degradation, you end up spending hours rerunning prompts, tweaking edge cases, and wondering why something that should work just doesn’t.\n\nAnd don’t even get me started on debugging.

Engineers deal with complex workflows, lengthy technical documents, coordination of suppliers, and more. This causes errors every day—often preventable, yet they still cause costly delays.\n\n✅ Our Solution Meet Cooper – an AI Mechanical Engineer that detects and fixes design errors in large engineering teams. Cooper scans your project files (drives, emails, CAE/CAD tools) to flag design errors before they escalate. By integrating with engineering software, our agent fixes design issues automatically in complex workflows.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/r0NGof0gYgM?si=4X4-YixVCgUOask7",

   "YC_Description": "TLDR; Mecha Health helps radiologists save time and effort by producing draft reports of medical images using AI. The Problem: Too Many Scans Not Enough Doctors. Due to a shortage of experts, US radiologists have to read 100 - 250+ studies per day, and this means that 55% have reported high levels of burnout. Additionally, patients sometimes have to wait days to receive medical reports for their scans due to backlogs. At times, this can result in preventable patient harm. Our Solution: Accurate & Interpretable Medical Image Analysis. We improve the reporting process by producing draft reports with AI and have invented new science to do this both accurately and safely. Our system can trace every finding to its visual source in the image and evidence each finding with examples from the training dataset. This allows for transparent reporting that doctors can trust.\n\nOur Background: Frontier Scientific Expertise. We are leading researchers in machine learning and medical imaging having published in tier-one AI venues (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML). Nina , Ahmed & Deji crossed paths through University College London’s Medical Imaging PhD program. Hugo met the team after he published AI research that was cited by Anthropic. Ahmed, a trained medical doctor from Imperial College London, witnessed firsthand how reporting delays harm patient outcomes—driving Mecha Health’s mission to transform radiology.\n\nOur Ask: Intros to Pioneering Medical Professionals and Healthcare Executives.

   "YC_Description": "We were both engineers at Tesla when one day, we had a fun idea to make a YouTube video of Cybertrucks in Palo Alto. The idea was simple: we’d record cars going by and for each Cybertruck we counted, we’d buy a share of Tesla stock. It had all the makings of a viral video, but after recording, we came back to hours of raw footage of cars driving by. It quickly dawned on us that we’d have to scrub through this entire raw footage to count the Cybertrucks. As we began editing, we experienced firsthand the frustration of trying to accomplish simple tasks in video editors like DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Premiere Pro. Features are hidden behind menus, buttons, and icons, and we often found ourselves Googling or asking ChatGPT how to do certain edits. We thought that now — with multimodal AI — we could accelerate some of this process. And better yet, if the AI is built into your video editor, it could automatically apply edits based off what it sees and hears in your video. The idea quickly snowballed and we began our side quest to build the Cursor for Video Editing.\n\nWe spent the first month of YC building our entire video editor and making our multimodal chat copilot powerful and stateful. But after talking to users, we quickly realized that the chat interface has some limitations for video, primarily because of chat’s inherent prompt-response sequential UX. We spent month 2 of YC going back to first principles to create a new, agentic paradigm for video editing. The result: a node-based canvas which enables you to create and run your own multimodal video editing agents. The idea is that canvas will run your video editing on autopilot, and get you 80-90% of the way there. Then, you can go into the editor & chat with your video for the final touches and polish.",

Additionally, these reactors face significant physics challenges for steady-state operation, such as managing first wall heat flux and mitigating nuclear activation of structural components that require novel materials to solve.\n\nThe Solution We are leveraging the most proven approach to fusion energy, the HTS tokamak, but designed specifically for maritime applications. This reactor bridges the gap between achieving breakeven fusion and commercial viability. Our target market, commercial shipping vessels, require 15x less power and lower uptime compared to traditional grid reactors all while matching the cost of alternative bunker fuels—without any emissions. Operating at reduced power densities also alleviates many of the materials hurdles, paving the way for a more robust and reliable technology in the near term. We’re also leveraging the same reactor to meet the Department of Defense’s need for mobile power plants via Ship-to-Shore power.\n\nWho We Are Our team brings over a decade of industry and research experience in plasma physics, nuclear engineering, and electrical engineering with backgrounds at SpaceX, Tesla, Columbia University, and University of Pennsylvania.

Energy providers pull meter readings from thousands of devices, fashion marketplaces standardize product data from various retailers, and fintech companies normalize transaction data across payment systems. Each system speaks its own language, forcing developers to write and maintain custom code to transform and normalize data. It's a massive waste of engineering resources and slows down business innovation.\n\nsuperglue is an intelligent proxy server that automatically transforms data from external APIs into your desired format, eliminating the need for custom mapping code. By sitting between your application and APIs, it allows developers to define data structures once and apply consistent transformations across all integrations, turning complex data integration from a weeks-long project into a minutes-long configuration.

   "YC_Description": "The core system of record in education -- the student information system (SIS) -- is broken. Schools run all of their software on top of it, but most teachers and administrators avoid using their SIS as much as possible. Traditionally, the SIS has been a database with a UI, but we believe that the SIS of the future will be providing “compliance-as-a-service”, handling every administrative task schools have to deal with, so educators at every level can focus on optimizing instruction.\n\nBy law, schools have to collect and report mountains of data. It takes large teams of people a ton of time to ingest, validate, audit, and report data to the government. They develop their own manual pipelines to try to improve these processes, but there’s no unified pipeline, and it often involves several rounds of manual auditing to make sure the data is accurate.\n\nEven with all of these redundant checks, these are manual processes, and schools make mistakes. When the annual audit comes around, schools lose funding for every mistake - and it can come out to hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses.\n\nScout automates the entire school compliance pipeline, from data ingestion to internal audits to government reporting. Our AI agents use drip campaigns to remind parents and students to submit documents, we continuously monitor all data for compliance throughout the school year, and Scout’s end-to-end reporting features compress reporting from a month-long process to something that can be done in a few hours.",

   "YC_Description": "Astro uses AI to find and buy land for new renewable energy projects, secure agreements to connect them to the power grid at minimal costs, and then sell these development-ready projects to larger energy companies.\n\nThe Problem The renewable energy transition faces a critical bottleneck: the US needs to add 2,000 gigawatts of new power generation by 2035 to support growing electricity demand from AI data centers and electrification.  Building these new power plants requires finding suitable land and connecting them to the grid - but this is where projects fail. Most potential locations are unprofitable because developers discover too late that they need to spend millions upgrading power lines and infrastructure for grid connection. Traditional energy developers spend months evaluating single locations, only to have projects die when they discover these hidden costs.\n\nThe Solution Astro’s proprietary AI models predict these grid connection costs upfront, enabling it to buy the most profitable land before costs increase. Astro’s models handle all the early development work - from finding the right location to securing grid connection agreements - creating a pipeline of development-ready projects that larger energy companies can immediately start building.\n\nBackstory I’m Alex, I studied physics + computer science at Stanford and was an energy trader at Citadel. While trading energy markets, I discovered that power grid congestion patterns are highly predictable - but developers aren’t using this data.

This is challenging because (1) markets are volatile and (2) complex and frequent regulatory updates make it difficult to assess both the revenue impact of rule changes and compliance risks.\n\nTo make money on the grid, battery owners must analyze market data and keep up with thousands of constantly changing regulatory documents. Electricity markets work like auctions -- every 5 minutes, battery owners decide how much power to buy or sell and at what price. Even the most data-savvy teams can’t keep up, leaving owners with little visibility into how others are making money. And rule changes aren’t just small tweaks – they can completely upend the market. To avoid financial penalties, battery owners spend millions on lawyers and consultants just to stay compliant.",

After a quick discussion with Max, the idea for Vetnio was born.\n\nProblem With a rising patient load, veterinarians are overworked and stressed, leading to mistakes, burnout, and lost revenue.

It bottlenecks builders and suppliers from winning new contracts as they’re bogged down with the tedious process of bidding. There are massive manual estimation and bidding teams in-house and outsourced.\n\nWe're bringing construction blueprints into the present with artificial intelligence. Bild AI ingests blueprint files and applies computer vision models and large language models to calculate detailed material quantity and cost estimates for flooring, doors, hardware and more. Our first clients are using Bild AI to bid on 10x more projects, with confidence in the accuracy of the estimates. This is just one application of blueprint processing that our clients use today, but our vision extends to permitting and architecture checks.\n\nPuneet Sukhija built his first house at 16 and has since overseen hundreds of construction projects, experiencing firsthand the frustration of working with complex blueprints. Roop Pal started at Google at 19 before moving to Waymo, where he built computer vision models to interpret complex traffic signal patterns for self-driving cars. They are exited founders applying their experience to automate blueprint analysis—helping builders focus on what matters: building.",

Beyond answering generic questions, our AI agents can actually take actions like \"replace my card\" or \"dispute this charge\" while maintaining human-like conversation.\n\nCustomer service is one of the largest operational spends across banks (15% opex), insurance (40% opex), and fintechs. However, call centers offer inconsistent service quality despite the cost.\n\nExisting AI solutions only read off of public documents and deflect the user — they can’t access account-specific data or take actions like human agents would. In financial services, this causes extreme user frustration.\n\nTrace AI agents securely integrate with core systems to offer instant, 24/7 resolution over the phone. So far, we achieve 95% end-to-end resolution of calls across quoting, card applications, transaction tracking, and more — all while following policy and never leaking sensitive data. With under 0.2s time to first token, we are also optimized for seamless interactions over voice.",

We are tackling conditions like epilepsy, debilitating symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and Parkinson’s disease by focusing on the neural circuitry of the brain.\n\nMillions of people around the world suffer from neurological disorders. These disorders arise from imbalances in brain activity. Think of it like an orchestra where some instruments are playing too loud while others are too quiet. This “bad music” / neural imbalance—what we call excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) imbalance—is the root cause of many symptoms in these disorders. For example, in epilepsy, overactive circuits lead to seizures, while in ASD, it can cause sensory hypersensitivities - where individuals feel overwhelmed by normal sounds, lights, or touch that most people wouldn't even notice. These dysregulations in neural circuits impact how the brain processes information and responds to the world, leading to the debilitating symptoms we see in these disorders.\n\nWe’re taking a circuit-level approach to treating brain disorders. Instead of trying to restore missing genes, we’re supplementing already existing genes that we know will be directly changing the neural activity in the brain - in the direction that we want and independently of the genetic background.\n\nWe are also working on a multimodal AI model to streamline our preclinical R&D. Why? Well, because developing drugs for the brain is really tough. Every candidate needs to be tested for its ability to modulate circuits, and doing that through a traditional drug development preclinical pathway is a slow process. Because of that, we use ML to analyze high-density multimodal data sets and prioritize which drugs are worth testing further. We use neural activity, behavior, and transcriptomics to train multimodal AI models that identify the drivers of the disease not observable by conventional analytical methods.",

   "YC_Description": "Leeroo delivers trainable AI agents that learn much like human colleagues— from knowledge bases, human feedback, and even their own past experiences. That continuous learning bridges the gap between generic AI and the expert performance companies need. We’re starting with agents for data- and AI-teams .\n\nAI agents look impressive, but for specialized work they remain semi-experts—and you can’t effectively train them into experts. General-purpose agents can’t learn from their own experience, human guidance, or domain-specific materials, so they quickly plateau at basic capabilities. Data and AI tasks demand deep specialization that off-the-shelf agents simply don’t reach.\n\nScaling pre-training to squeeze out marginally better foundation models has flat-lined. The real moat isn’t building demo agents, it’s training that agent to expert level on your private context. While agent scaffolding is commoditising fast, Leeroo’s on-prem, continuous-learning engine transforms your data, workflows, and tacit know-how into a compounding strategic asset—without leaving your VPC.\n\nOur early customers already see their trained agents as high-value assets—assets that appreciate as the agents keep mastering more of the organisation’s knowledge.",

   "YC_Description": "Hi! I’m Alex, founder of Egress Health. We’re building AI agents to automate the work healthcare providers do to get paid by insurance (aka “revenue cycle management”). Our first customers are dental clinics.\n\nIn the back of every healthcare provider's office there are staff who spend their whole day doing repetitive, mundane tasks necessary to get reimbursed by insurance. Failure to keep up with this work results in significant (sometimes existential) financial loss.\n\nWe learned about these consequences from a family friend, who is a dental provider. Suffering from staff turnover, the practice where she worked struggled to collect even 70% of what they were owed and nearly missed payroll as a result.\n\nThis story is not uncommon. Healthcare providers will spend >$160B on revenue cycle work this year and even the best run clinics still won’t collect everything they are owed.",

Our vision is simple: a future where public servants work at the speed of thought, empowered by a system that understands their workflows, integrates with all their tools, and eliminates the friction of fragmented software.\n\nGovernment work is critical for our country, but across federal, state, and local agencies, it’s being slowed to a crawl by outdated software, siloed systems, and manual processes. Every day, public servants spend hours on repetitive, low-leverage tasks: retyping information across systems, routing emails between departments, tracking sentiment in spreadsheets, and responding to routine inquiries in Word docs. The tools they rely on rarely integrate. Critical data is fragmented. When someone calls about a missing VA check or a passport delay, staffers often re-enter the same information multiple times, and real help can take days or even weeks to arrive\n\nThis isn't just inefficiency. It is a failure at scale. And it’s because no software truly wraps around the way government employees work.",
